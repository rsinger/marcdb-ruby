A port of Ed Summer's marcdb application (http://inkdroid.org/journal/2007/10/01/marcdb/) to Ruby.

Usage:
  
  Initialize the database.  This defaults to SQLite, but it uses DataMapper, so any database supported by DM can be swapped in (edit models.rb to change).
  
  $ ruby marcdb.rb init
  
  Load some records.
  
  $ ruby marcdb.rb load /path/to/records/file (marc|xml)
  
  For now you have to specify what serialization your file is (MARC binary or marcxml)
  
  You can also view a record by 001
  
  $ ruby marcdb.rb view 1234
